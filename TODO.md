* Implement a Key items-only menu similar to Mother 3, exclusively for Key items during the story so they don't clutter up space in the main inventory.
* Implement a Tools items-only menu similar to Mother 3 with Duster, exclusively for Battle items that can be reused infinitely by Jeff. This can be a copy-paste from the Key items one, but it will require a Battle hijack as well so it can be used in battle.
* Implement special running sprites for when using the Run button similar to Mother 3. This should apply for all party characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff, Poo; and guest party characters: Porky, Picky, Flying Men, Tony, Bubble Monkey, King. Possibly Dungeon Man too but it depends.
* Floating sprite implementation for when Ness receives a phone call, similar to Mother 3's Transceiver. It should be made similar to how Capt. Strong does it in Onett. (Some receiver calls from Orange kid are in data_34)
* Fix the Last Sanctuary locations showing up in the wrong order, when getting all 8 melodies and all sanctuaries flash quickly
* Check the Fly Honey softlock and fix it
