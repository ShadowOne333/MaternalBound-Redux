* Implement a Key items-only menu similar to Mother 3, exclusively for Key items during the story so they don't clutter up space in the main inventory.
* Implement special running sprites for when using the Run button similar to Mother 3. This should apply for all party characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff, Poo; and guest party characters: Porky, Picky, Flying Men, Tony, Bubble Monkey, King. Possibly Dungeon Man too but it depends.
* Floating sprite implementation for when Ness receives a phone call, similar to Mother 3's Transceiver. It should be made similar to how Capt. Strong does it in Onett.
